Chapter 1.
Cocoa as Universal Currency:
During the splendor of the Mexica Empire, cocoa stood out as a universal exchange rate 
due to its commercial value. The residents of Tenochtitlan (the capital of the Mexica 
Empire) were organized into clans and used cocoa as a means of exchange.
The Tlatelolco market was the most important place of commerce in the Mexica Empire. There, 
spices, animals, ceramics and a variety of fruits were offered. Cocoa was the currency used 
throughout the empire.
The term “cacao” comes from Nahuatl, where “cac” means red, referring to the 
reddish color of cocoa seeds.
