Chapter 2
The Value of Cocoa:
Cacao was a medium-sized tree that produced thick almonds. Only experienced 
workers could grow it, as they had to know the signs of ripening to prolong its 
productive life.
In addition to being the typical drink and food of the Empire, cocoa was used in traditional 
herbalism to relieve discomfort.
Its most important use was related to the ritual function. Chocolatl, one of the four 
varieties of cocoa beans, was the best and could only be used by the elites in power. It 
was used in coronation ceremonies for political leaders.
